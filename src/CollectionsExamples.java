        //Collection = A data structure that can be used to group,
        // or collect objects. The 'Java standard library', a
        // collection of code that comes with the Java language,
        // contains many collections to help with common
        // programming tasks.

        // The collection classes come from the 'java.util' package.
        // The two most common are 'Arraylist', and 'HashMaps'.


        // *** Array Lists *** \\

        // ArrayList = a class that represents an array that can change
        // it's size. All elements in an 'ArrayList' must be objects,
        // and they must have the same type. Arrays in Java have a fixed
        // length; meaning that once they are created they cannot change
        // their length. In order to "add" an item to an array, you must
        // make a copy of the array with a length bigger than the original.
