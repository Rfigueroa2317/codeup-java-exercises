    // Annotations are used to provide metadata for Java code. Annotations don't
    // modify the execution of code; however, they can be consumed in order to
    // perform additional logic.

    // A Java annotation, in its shortest form, looks like this:

    // @Entity

    // *** The @ character signals to the compiler that this is an annotation. The
    // name following the @ character is the name of the annotation. ***
